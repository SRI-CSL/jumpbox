Jeroen and Ian need to puff this up into a real description.


Ian's current idea of the design will require that:


===  Jump Box API ===

In response to a **pull** request:

jump_box should serve the content of the stegotorus client's request with the following
additional headers:

DJB_URI: <this should be the uri of the stegotorus client request>
DJB_METHOD: <this should be the method (i.e. GET or POST) of the stegotorus client request>

DJB_CONTENT_TYPE: <this should be the content-type of the stegotorus client request> (only POSTs?)

DJB_COOKIE: <this should be *instead of* any cookie header in the stegotorus client request>


In handling a **push** request:

jump_box should pay attention to the

DJB_SET_COOKIE: 

and convert it to the usual Set-Cookie header before passing it on to the stegotorus client (actually
this could easily be done by the chrome plugin).
